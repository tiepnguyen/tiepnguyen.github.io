# Tiep Nguyen

A web & mobile developer based in HCM city who specialize in simplicity and efficiency

## About Me

My aim is to create vibrant, detailed applications while keeping standards and usability aspects in mind

### Design

I use industry standard tools to help plan the full project lifecycle prior to commencement. Based on scoping, I use wireframes, user stories to create thoughtful design.

### Process

Every single line of code I write is manually review against established stylistic, security and procedural guidelines, automated test execution and static code analysis.

### Launch

By fully managed code repository and deployment system, products can be deployed reliably and securely, to ensure the switchover is as smooth as possible.
